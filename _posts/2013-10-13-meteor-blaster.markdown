Meteor Blaster is a game inspired from Atari's retro classic arcade game "Asteroids".

Destroy the asteroids to score points. Collect powerups like rapid fire, invincibility, health restore and nuke. Meteor Blaster is a great game to play in short bursts when you're bored or are waiting somewhere.

Please rate and comment. Thanks.

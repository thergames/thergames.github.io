Once again the crystals are in danger. This time it is the evil Black Knights and their horde of monsters. Help Helm Knight fight his way through the forces of evil and secure the crystals.

Run, jump and avoid obstacles. Use portals to gain access to otherwise unreachable parts of the terrain. Fight enemies like snails, slimes, snakes, skeletons, flame shooting plants, ice monsters and the very formidable forces of the Black Knights, across 30 levels spanning 3 different locales - the Plains, the Desert, and the Snowy Mountains. Collect coins and purchase health and potion upgrades.

The interesting action platforming features, cartoony graphics and the fitting audio, make sure that Helm Knight 2 provides a fun gaming experience.

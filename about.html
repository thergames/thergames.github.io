Hi there! I’m Rishabh, a front-end web developer from Bangalore (India). I code in html, css, JavaScript, Java, C, C++ among others. WeatherFox, Chart Glazer, StackDeck, Citrine Timer, Notifyr, beeTooltip and Notebook are some of my open-source projects. When I’m away from my laptop, I like to enjoy the simple things in life — a stroll in the park, reading a book or looking at the night sky.
